 <h2>Natonya Stewart</h2>
 <p>My name is Natonya Stewart. I am student currently studying Economics and Computer Science at the University of the West Indies, Mona. I am interested in Web development because it allows me to express my ideas and creativity. Web Development is also an opportunity for growth and flexibility. Outside of work, I'm interested in following the developments of science. I also play a lot of video games and watch TikToks.</p>
